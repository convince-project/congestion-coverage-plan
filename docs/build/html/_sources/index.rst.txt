Welcome to CONGESTION-COVERAGE-PLAN documentation!
==================================================

CONGESTION-COVERAGE-PLAN is an online tool for *tour planning in crowded, human-populated environments*.

CONGESTION-COVERAGE-PLAN operates over a topological graph.
The dynamics model, known as a `CLiFF <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7835155/>`_ map, captures the speed and direction of human motion at different points in the environment.
This model is learned from human motion data collected on LIDARs placed around the environment.
The online tour planner uses the CLiFF map to build and solve an `MDP <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470316887>`__.
The MDP is solved using `labeled real-time dynamic programming (LRTDP) <https://cdn.aaai.org/ICAPS/2003/ICAPS03-002.pdf>`_.
Before deployment, the user must specify the topological map and the robot's starting position.
